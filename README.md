# Star Wars Galaxy Map

This project provides a simple interactive map of the Star Wars galaxy inspired by the official map on [starwars.com](https://www.starwars.com/star-wars-galaxy-map). The map lets you pan and zoom around a stylized star field and highlights key systems with regions marked by color.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Drag to pan and use the mouse wheel or pinch gesture to zoom in and out.
