# Star Wars Galaxy Map

Interactive map inspired by the [official Star Wars galaxy map](https://www.starwars.com/star-wars-galaxy-map). Pan and zoom to explore notable systems. Itâ€™s pretty cool. Tada! 

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. The map supports mouse wheel zoom and click-drag panning.

## Development

This project is static and has no build step. A minimal test script is included to satisfy tooling.
